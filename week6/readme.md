## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mirrdj/C5-visual-recognition-G2.git
   cd C5-visual-recognition-G2/week6

2.  **Create missing directories**:

To use this work, the project structure below needs to be achieved.
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project. This is where you develop your main functionality, including scripts, modules, and any supporting code. To run the main script, use the following command:
- **predictions/**: Holds the prediction results generated by the code in `src/` in CSV format. These are used for the evaluation of the results.
- **data/**: Stores the dataset used by the project. 

3.  **Run project**:
To run the project, use the following command:
```bash
python src/run_optuna.py
```

In order to modify the model to be run, as the script does not currently support arguments, the variable on line 96 needs to be changed according to the options present in _get_combination_.
